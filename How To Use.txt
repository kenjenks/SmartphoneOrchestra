How to use this for your first run:

1. Firebase Settings: Ensure both files use the exact same Firebase project.

2. Order of Operations: * Open laptopdist.html and click Initialize Audio Engine. The status should say STANDBY.

  Open smartphonedist.html on your Pixel 6.

  As soon as you hit START on the phone, the laptop's LED will turn green and begin chirping silently.

3. The 3m Baseline: Stand exactly 3 meters away. The phone will show a progress bar for 60 seconds. Once finished, you are live!
